# Hostel-Room-Allotment-System
Application of Data Structure and Algorithm
The project is a room allotment system which can actually replace the existing system. It is fully functional and provides the same features provided by the current system used by our college for hostel room allotment, plus some extra features such as finding the occupants of a room or finding a student in the room matirx. We will be using C++ programing language.
